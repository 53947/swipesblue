## SwipesBlue Final Polish — Let's Get This Right

We're close to having a professional, Stripe-quality site. These final fixes will take it from "almost there" to "ready to impress."

### FIX 1: Header Alignment

**The issue:** Navigation links (Products, Pricing, Dashboard) are floating higher than the logo text. Everything should sit on the same visual line.

**The solution:**
- Apply `display: flex` and `align-items: center` to the header container
- All elements should be vertically centered in a single row:
  - Left: Logo (icon + "swipesblue" text)
  - Center: Nav links
  - Right: Sign in + Get Started button

**Success looks like:** One clean horizontal line across the header — no elements floating higher or lower than others.

### FIX 2: Hero Visual Element

**The issue:** The right side of the hero section is empty white space. You confirmed the image was added, but nothing is rendering.

**The solution:**
Use the attached image file (marching_colors.png) directly. Add it to the right side of the hero section.

- Position it on the right half of the hero
- Size/crop appropriately so it flows with the layout
- The image sits ON the white background
- Do NOT recreate it, do NOT use it as "inspiration" — use the actual image file I provided

**Success looks like:** The hero section has the tagline on the left and the marching_colors.png image displaying on the right.

### FIX 3: Remaining Polish (After 1 & 2 Are Approved)

**A. Footer**
- Match Stripe's footer: white or light gray (#F5F5F5) background
- Multi-column layout with category headers (Products, Resources, Company, Support)
- Clean typography, generous whitespace
- Copyright line at bottom
- Reference: https://stripe.com (scroll to footer)

**B. Mega Menus**
- Navigation dropdowns should be full-width Stripe-style mega menus
- White background, organized columns, category headers
- Smooth open/close animation
- Reference: https://stripe.com — click "Products" in their nav

**C. Button Consistency**
- Audit ALL buttons site-wide
- Every button should use: `border-radius: 7px`
- No pill-shaped buttons (too rounded)
- No sharp square corners (0px)
- Consistent across homepage, pricing, demo pages, dashboard, admin
