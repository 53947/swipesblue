## CORRECTIONS REQUIRED — Fix these issues ONE AT A TIME

### 1. HEADER LOGO
Still duplicated. Show "swipesblue" ONE TIME only (icon + wordmark together). Remove the duplicate text.

### 2. HERO VISUAL
Replace the current pastel gradient blob with a dynamic "swoosh" design inspired by the attached image (swooch_in_color.png).

**Requirements:**
- Create a flowing, curved swoosh/wave design
- Use the SwipesBlue brand colors: Red (#E00420), Blue Pure (#0000FF), Blue Deep (#1844A6), Purple (#A855F7), Teal (#064A6C)
- Should feel like motion/movement (represents the "swipe" in SwipesBlue)
- Position on the right side of the hero, flowing diagonally
- Do NOT copy the attached image exactly — use it as inspiration to create something original
- Keep the white background — the swoosh should sit ON the white, not replace it

### 3. HEADLINE COPY
Change to MY tagline, not Stripe's:

**Main headline:** "Built for businesses to grow"
**Sub headline:** "Less fees. More revenue."
**Description:** "Simple payment processing for small businesses and developers. Accept cards, manage transactions, and scale without complexity."

### 4. SECONDARY BUTTON
Change "Contact sales" to "View Documentation"

### 5. BUTTON STYLING — GLOBAL FIX
Buttons are inconsistent across the site. Some are rounded, some are square.

**Fix ALL buttons site-wide to use this standard:**
```css
border-radius: 7px;
```

This applies to:
- Primary buttons (red)
- Secondary/outline buttons
- All buttons on every page

No fully rounded buttons (pill shape). No sharp square corners. **7px border-radius everywhere.**
